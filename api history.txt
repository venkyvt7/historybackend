Unlike some other types of dinosaurs, Abelisaurus walked on two legs or was bipedal. The species was thought to be 7 to 9 meters in length and hence was considered a medium-sized dinosaur.How did the modern Era learn about Abelisaurus? Through a single skull that was found! And that too was incomplete. Through this skull, scientists were able to identify Abelisaurus’s diet, lifestyle and size.",

They typically date to the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago), but the earliest known Venus figurine (Venus of Hohle Fels) dates to at least 35,000 years ago, and the most recent (Venus of Monruz) dates to roughly 11,000 years ago. They are most common in the Mediterranean region, but there are examples from as far as Siberia. Archaeologists can only speculate on their meaning, but their ubiquitous nature indicates a universal human attraction to art and possibly religion..\n\n",
